# Drone Tree Identification using DeepForest

This repository contains the code and resources for my degree project, which focuses on deploying and measuring performance of a pre-trained 'deepforest' model to analyze drone-captured imagery for tree identification.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyse the performance of the deep learning framework DeepForest in identifying tree species from high-resolution drone images.

# Features

- Pre-trained DeepForest Model: Utilizing the 'deepforest' model for tree detection and classification.
- Image Preprocessing: Includes steps for preparing drone imagery to increase model performance.
- Result Interpretation: Tools and scripts to analyze and interpret the outputs of the model for accuracy assessment and ecological insights.
# Getting Started
